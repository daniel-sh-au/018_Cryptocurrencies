# Module 18: Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to group the cryptocurrency data into clusters and to visualize the results. Since the data was not ideal for unsupervised machine learning, it was first preprocessed for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, PCA was applied to the cleaned dataset to reduce the dimensions from 98 columns into 3 principal components. Next, the data was clustered with an appropriate k value and seperated into classes. Finally, the cryptocurrency data was visualized with a plotly 3d-scatter plot and a hvplot scatter plot. 

### Resources
* Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7.13
